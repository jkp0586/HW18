Homework Assignment 18

Assignment Summary:

Though I was able to get through the beginning of the assignment, I was unable to successfully perform any mining of node1 or node2. Both were stuck on "Looking For Peers". Additionally, I was unable to connect to the custom network created in MyCrypto. This is precisely where I got stuck in class exercise 18.3, although at least in the class exercise I was able to successfully begin mining of node1. In summary, I was unable to transfer any test Ethereum as the assignment calls for.
